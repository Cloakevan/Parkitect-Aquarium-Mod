Currently just exploring ways to prevent another loss of all my work by a total failure. Project Aquarium Mod "2.0" is starting up from scratch.
But we're just getting started. More will follow, dare I say it, sooooon!
Meanwhile check out [Parkitect on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThemeParkitect), for previous Aquarium Mod progress updates, and other news by the lovely community.
